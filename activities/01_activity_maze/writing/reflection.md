## Part 1

Q1: List the tools you installed.

`TODO`

Q2: Did you encounter any issues during the installation process? If so, how did you resolve them?

`TODO`

Q3: For each of the software tools you installed, describe its purpose and provide one feature that you find particularly useful or exciting about it.

`TODO`

Q4: How do you plan to use these tools in your future programming projects?

`TODO`

## Part 2

## Reflection: Maze and Instruction-Writing Activity

Please answer the following questions thoughtfully and, again, using clear and meaningful language. These questions are to help you to reflect on the activity that you just completed using mazes and the solution instructions that your wrote. You are now going to connect this activity to programming computers in light of how they follow instructions in source code.

Q5: Which maze (filename) did you choose to solve?

`TODO`

Q5: Which maze (filename) did your partner choose to solve?

`TODO`

Q6: When you followed your partner group's instructions to solve their maze, did you encounter any steps that were unclear or ambiguous? How did you handle these situations, and what does this reveal about the importance of precision in instructions?

`TODO`

Q7: If you made a mistake or got stuck while following the instructions, what was the cause? Was it due to an error in the instructions, a misunderstanding, or something else? How does this relate to errors that can occur when a computer runs source code?

`TODO`

Q8: Imagine a computer following your group's instructions exactly as written, without any ability to guess or improvise. Would the computer be able to solve the maze successfully? Why or why not?

`TODO`

Q9: How did you decide what details to include or leave out when writing your own instructions? What challenges did you face in making your instructions both complete and easy to follow?

`TODO`

Q10: Based on your experience, what are some strategies for writing instructions (or source code) that minimize errors and confusion for the person or computer following them?
